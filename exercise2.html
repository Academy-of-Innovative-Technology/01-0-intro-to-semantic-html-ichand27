                <h4>Isis's Interests</h4>
                <p>I like to draw, many mediums are great for art and I like to use traditional as well as modern forms. Things like oil pastels, paper machet, origmai, painting, sketching, and water colors are all medium thats I have and will continue to enjoy. More modern things like digital apps, using 3D modeling, animation, photoshop, an graphic design are also other forms I want to continue to use.</p>
